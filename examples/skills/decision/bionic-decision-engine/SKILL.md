# Bionic Decision Engine — The Universal Arbitrator

> **Compiled**: 2026-05-11 (retroactive synthesis of 70+ protocols)
> **Problem Class**: Any "Should I?" question across all life domains — career, trades, purchases, relationships, time allocation.
> **Axiom**: *"If you can't put a number on it, you can't decide on it. And if you decide on feelings, the wound decides for you (MP-8)."*

## When to Use

Invoke whenever the user faces a resource allocation decision. This includes:
- "Should I take this job/trade/client/deal?"
- "Is this worth the money/time/energy?"
- "Which option is better?"
- "Should I stay or leave?"
- Pricing questions (what to charge, what to pay)
- Any comparison of two or more alternatives

## Solution Architecture

### Gate 0: The Sunk Cost Purge (MP-14)

Before ANY analysis:

> *"Would I enter this position TODAY if I weren't already in it?"*

If NO → the decision is already made. Skip to Exit Protocol.
If YES → proceed to Gate 1.

### Gate 1: Ruin Class Check (Law #1)

Does any option carry >5% probability of irreversible ruin across 5 domains?

| Domain | Ruin Threshold |
|--------|---------------|
| Biological | Death, permanent disability |
| Legal | Incarceration, criminal record |
| Financial | Bankruptcy, total capital loss |
| Social | De-platforming, exile |
| Psychological | Burnout Stage 4, loss of agency |

**VETO** if P(Ruin) > 5%. No calculation needed. No exceptions.

### Gate 2: The EEV Calculator (DEC-330 / DEC-526)

For each option, calculate Expected Economic Value:

```
EEV = P(success) × V(upside) − P(failure) × V(downside) − Friction Costs

Where:
  P(success) = base rate for demographic × personal edge multiplier
  V(upside)  = monetary + optionality + compounding value
  V(downside) = monetary loss + opportunity cost + psychological toll
  Friction   = time, energy, commute, complexity tax
```

**Anti-Rationalization Rule** (DEC-526): E(U) anchors MUST be activities you have **actually paid for** in the last 90 days. No hypotheticals.

### Gate 3: The Horizon Split (DEC-129)

| Horizon | Timeframe | Optimize For |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Tactical | 0–90 days | Cash flow, immediate survival |
| Operational | 90 days–1 year | Positioning, skill building |
| Strategic | 1–5 years | Asset building, compounding |

**Rule**: Never sacrifice Strategic for Tactical unless in survival mode. Every 90 days is "End of Year" crunch time.

### Gate 4: The Arena Diagnostic (MP-1 + MP-9)

```
              YOU OWN THE ARENA    YOU RENT THE ARENA
YOU SET PRICE:    Sovereign            Fragile
THEY SET PRICE:   Regulated            Subordinate
```

**Fulcrum Check** (MP-9): Are you pushing harder or repositioning the lever?

| Lever Type | Examples | Multiplier |
|:-----------|:---------|:-----------|
| Substrate | AI ($200/mo) vs team ($15K/mo) | 10–100× |
| Arena | Owned vs rented platform | 2–10× |
| Pricing | Outcome vs hourly | 3–5× |
| Distribution | Owned vs paid channel | 5–50× |

### Gate 5: The Form-Substance Strip (MP-5)

> *"Strip the label. Describe only the mechanism. Does the mechanism match the label?"*

| Common Form | Actual Substance |
|:------------|:----------------|
| "Running my own business" | Self-employed, paying rent to arena owner |
| "Partner investing $300K" | Extraction vehicle for personal network |
| "Be your own boss" | Be your own employee |
| "Passionate connection" | Trauma-familiar pattern (MP-8) |
| "Optimal trade" | Hindsight artifact |

### Gate 6: Compounding Test (MP-6)

> *"If I stop working for 6 months, does income continue?"*

- **No** → Level 0–2. Linear. You ARE the asset.
- **Yes** → Level 3. Compounding. You OWN the asset.

Track `Hours Invested ÷ Revenue Generated` monthly. If the ratio is not decreasing, you are trapped.

## Failure Modes & Mitigations

| Failure | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Analysis Paralysis** | If EEV delta < 10%, flip a coin. The cost of delay > the cost of a slightly suboptimal choice. |
| **Sunk Cost Override** | Gate 0 MUST fire first. If you wouldn't re-enter today, EXIT. |
| **Wound-Selects-For-Itself** (MP-8) | If the option feels "familiar" and "comfortable," run the IFS check before proceeding. |
| **Information-Action Gap** (MP-10) | You already KNOW the answer. The question is what structural barrier prevents action. |
| **Hope Override** (CS-012) | "Hope > Data" is the most common failure. If data says no, no amount of hope changes the math. |

## Validated Patterns (Empirical)

- [V] **90-Day Physical Payment Anchor**: Only anchor EEV comparisons to things you've actually paid for in the last 90 days. Hypothetical anchors corrupt the calculation. | Reapply: Every pricing/value decision.
- [V] **The Walk**: Threatening withdrawal (P120) is the highest-leverage move in any negotiation. | Reapply: Any pricing pushback.
- [V] **Base Rate Audit**: If claimed outcome >> expected outcome for demographics, hidden variable EXISTS (DEC-140). | Reapply: Every "too good to be true" evaluation.
- [V] **Min-Max Optimization**: In purchases, buy the cheapest acceptable OR the best available. Never the middle. | Reapply: Every consumer purchase.
