# Reddit Post Draft — r/ChatGPT

**Flair**: `Educational Purpose Only`

## Title Options (pick one)

1. **Your AI doesn't have a memory problem. It has a hard drive problem. Here's the fix (open source, v9.1.0)**
2. **I posted the "Linux OS for AI Agents" 6 days ago (662K views). Here's what 288 devs helped me build since.**
3. **ChatGPT "forgot" your project again? That's not a bug — it's architecture. Here's the permanent fix.**

## Post Body

**6 days ago**, I posted Athena here and you guys broke my notifications. 700K+ views. #1 All-Time on this sub. 288 stars on GitHub.

The response told me one thing: **memory is the bottleneck, not intelligence.**

Every thread this week is about ChatGPT 5.3's personality, tone, sycophancy. But nobody is talking about the deeper problem: **every time you start a new chat, your AI gets amnesia.** Your project context, your decisions, your style preferences — gone. You're copy-pasting the same context into every session like it's 2023.

That's not a bug. That's **architecture**. ChatGPT Memory is RAM — volatile, vendor-controlled, silently pruned. What you need is a **hard drive**.

### What changed since last week (v8.5 → v9.1.0)

**The boring stuff (that actually matters):**

- 🔧 **Deep audit**: Fixed 15 issues — dead links, version drift, dependency sync, broken launch scripts
- 📦 **Dependency sync**: Added DSPy + FlashRank + DiskCache to the stack (pyproject.toml now matches reality)
- 🛡️ **Portability fix**: The daemon script was resolving paths *outside the repo*. Anyone who cloned it got a broken launch. Fixed.
- 📚 **Academic references**: Every claim in the repo is now traceable to its source (APA 7th edition, 40+ citations)

**The interesting stuff:**

- 🧠 **120+ protocols** — reusable decision frameworks for debugging, shipping, architecture, strategy
- 🔍 **Triple-path search** — BM25 + Semantic + GraphRAG. Hybrid retrieval that actually finds what you need
- 🏗️ **MCP Server** — 9 tools, 2 resources. Your IDE becomes the terminal for your AI's operating system
- 🔄 **Session persistence** — `/start` loads your last session's context. `/end` distills and commits to memory. Session 1,300 is *cleaner* than Session 100.

### The 30-second version

| | ChatGPT Memory | Athena |
|---|---|---|
| **Storage** | "User likes Python" | "In Session 847, user decided X because Y" |
| **Control** | Opaque. Can't edit. Can't export. | Git-versioned Markdown. You own it. |
| **Lifespan** | Until OpenAI prunes it | Forever |
| **Switch models?** | Start over | Memory stays mounted |

### Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public.git
cd Athena-Public
pip install -e .
athena init .
```

5 minutes. No API keys required for the core system. Works with Claude, Gemini, GPT — you only rent the intelligence, you **own** the state.

**GitHub**: [github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public)

### Why I built this

I'm a solo dev in Singapore. I use Athena daily — 1,300+ sessions, 4,200+ vector memories, 50+ quicksaves per week. It's not a demo. It's my actual development environment.

The insight that keeps landing: **the model is replaceable, the memory isn't.** When GPT-5 drops, I'll plug it in. My context stays. My protocols stay. My decisions stay.

If you used the original post's system and hit issues — they're probably fixed now. If you haven't tried it — the repo is actually portable this time. Promise.

## Notes for Winston

- **Timing**: Post between 9-11 AM EST (Mon-Wed) for maximum r/ChatGPT visibility
- **Engage**: Reply to every top-level comment in the first 2 hours. Reddit's algorithm rewards early engagement.
- **Don't**: Mention pricing or services. This is a credibility post, not a sales post.
- **Do**: If someone asks about a specific bug, link them to the exact commit that fixed it (`e31c1a0` or `08c9056`).
- **Flair**: Use "Educational Purpose Only" — avoids Rule 3 (Self Advertising) triggers
