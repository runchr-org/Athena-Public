> **Note**: Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve — the exponential decay of recall over time without reinforcement — is the basis for Athena's access-weighted memory decay. Memories not accessed in >30 days receive a decay penalty on retrieval scores; frequently co-activated procedural patterns receive permanence multipliers. Implemented in v9.4.2 via the Maintenance cluster.

## Microeconomics & Decision Theory

Bernoulli, D. (1738). Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis [Exposition of a new theory on the measurement of risk]. *Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae, 5*, 175–192. [English translation: *Econometrica, 22*(1), 23–36, 1954]

> **Note**: Bernoulli's 1738 paper is the origin of *expected utility theory*. He demonstrated that the subjective value of wealth is logarithmic (concave), not linear — resolving the St. Petersburg Paradox. This foundation underlies every utility-based decision framework in the Athena protocol library, including Protocol 330 (EEV).

Friedman, M., & Savage, L. J. (1948). The utility analysis of choices involving risk. *Journal of Political Economy, 56*(4), 279–304. <https://doi.org/10.1086/256692>

> **Note**: Friedman & Savage proposed a double-inflection utility function — concave at low and high wealth, convex in between — to explain why people simultaneously buy insurance (risk-averse) and lottery tickets (risk-seeking). This is the theoretical foundation of Protocol 330's Economic Expected Value (EEV) framework.

Kelly, J. L., Jr. (1956). A new interpretation of information rate. *Bell System Technical Journal, 35*(4), 917–926. <https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1956.tb03809.x>

von Neumann, J., & Morgenstern, O. (1944). *Theory of games and economic behavior*. Princeton University Press.

> **Note**: vNM formalized the axiomatic foundation of expected utility theory — completeness, transitivity, continuity, and independence. Their utility function is the standard against which all decision-under-uncertainty frameworks (including Friedman-Savage and Prospect Theory) are measured. Referenced in Protocol 330 (EEV).

Pareto, V. (1896). *Cours d'économie politique* [Course of political economy]. F. Rouge.

> **Note**: Pareto's work established the concept of *Pareto optimality* — a state where no dimension can be improved without degrading another. In Athena, this underpins Protocol 49 (Efficiency vs Robustness Trade-off): you operate on a Pareto frontier and choose your position explicitly. Protocol 106 (Min-Max Optimization) applies the same principle to procurement and resource allocation via the Sovereign Point ($S = \arg\max U(c)/c$).

Deb, K., Pratap, A., Agarwal, S., & Meyarivan, T. (2002). A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II. *IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6*(2), 182–197. <https://doi.org/10.1109/4235.996017>

> **Note**: NSGA-II is the canonical algorithm for multi-objective Pareto optimization — finding the set of non-dominated solutions along a trade-off frontier. Referenced conceptually in Protocol 49 §49.9 (Pushing the Pareto Frontier) where Athena's architecture shifts the efficiency-robustness frontier outward.

Roy, B. (1991). The outranking approach and the foundations of ELECTRE methods. *Theory and Decision, 31*(1), 49–73. <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00134132>

Saaty, T. L. (1980). *The analytic hierarchy process: Planning, priority setting, resource allocation*. McGraw-Hill.

> **Note on MCDA**: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a family of methods, not a single paper. Athena's implementation draws primarily from weighted-sum models (Fishburn, 1967) and pairwise comparison (Saaty, 1980). See also: Belton, V., & Stewart, T. J. (2002). *Multiple criteria decision analysis: An integrated approach*. Springer.

Fishburn, P. C. (1967). Additive utilities with incomplete product sets: Application to priorities and assignments. *Operations Research, 15*(3), 537–542.

Peters, O. (2019). The ergodicity problem in economics. *Nature Physics, 15*(12), 1216–1221. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0732-0>

> **Note**: Peters demonstrated that the ensemble average (expected value across many agents) and the time average (expected value for one agent over time) diverge in multiplicative dynamics — making standard expected utility theory inapplicable to non-ergodic situations. This is the formal foundation of Athena's Law #1 (No Irreversible Ruin): in non-ergodic systems, a single absorbing state (bankruptcy, liquidation) makes the game's time-average payoff zero regardless of its ensemble-average payoff. Protocol 330 (EEV) and Protocol 001 (Law of Ruin) are direct applications.

Model Context Protocol. (2024). *Model Context Protocol Specification* (v1.0). Anthropic / Agentic AI Foundation. <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/>

> **Note**: MCP is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 that standardizes how AI systems connect to external data sources, tools, and systems. It provides a client-server architecture with JSON-RPC 2.0 transport, enabling tools, resources, and prompts to be exposed to any compatible agent. Athena's MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) exposes 9 tools and 2 resources. Governance was donated to the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) in late 2025.

Hou, X., Zhao, Y., Wang, S., & Wang, H. (2025). Model Context Protocol (MCP): Landscape, security threats, and future research directions. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.23278*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23278>

> **Note**: First systematic security analysis of MCP — maps the lifecycle, architectural components, and threat taxonomy. Relevant to Athena's security posture: all MCP tools are gated by the Permissioning Layer (Protocol 409) and Secret Mode redaction.

Park, J. S., O'Brien, J. C., Cai, C. J., Morris, M. R., Liang, P., & Bernstein, M. S. (2023). Generative agents: Interactive simulacra of human behavior. *Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST)*, Article 2, 1–22. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442>

> **Note**: Park et al. demonstrated that LLM-based agents with persistent memory, reflection, and planning can produce believable human behavior in simulation. Their architecture — observe → reflect → plan → act — is structurally similar to Athena's session lifecycle (/start → work → /end → session log). The key insight: *reflection* (periodic synthesis of raw observations into higher-level abstractions) is what separates agents from chatbots.

Hong, S., Zhuge, M., Chen, J., Zheng, X., Cheng, Y., Zhang, C., ... & Wu, Y. (2024). MetaGPT: Meta programming for a multi-agent collaborative framework. *International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00352>

> **Note**: MetaGPT introduced Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) for multi-agent coordination — structured role assignment with explicit handoff protocols. Athena's Protocol 413 (Multi-Agent Coordination) and the `/416-agent-swarm` workflow implement similar principles: worktree isolation, coordinator synthesis, and never-stash safety rules.

Li, G., Hammoud, H. A. A. K., Itani, H., Khizbullin, D., & Ghanem, B. (2024). CAMEL: Communicative agents for "mind" exploration of large language model society. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760>

> **Note**: CAMEL demonstrated role-playing communication between AI agents to solve complex tasks. The "inception prompting" technique — where each agent is given a role and communicates through structured messages — informed Athena's synthetic parallel reasoning skill (Protocol 75 v4.0), which deploys 4 virtual personas (Domain Expert, Adversarial Skeptic, Cross-Domain Pattern Matcher, First-Principles Analyst) with an adversarial convergence gate.

> **Note**: FlashRank provides lightweight, CPU-efficient cross-encoder reranking without GPU dependencies. Athena's hybrid RAG pipeline uses FlashRank as the final reranking stage after BM25 + semantic retrieval + RRF fusion, achieving 85% recall on personal knowledge bases at $0/month infrastructure cost.

> **Note**: Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) distinguishes intrinsic load (task complexity), extraneous load (poor design), and germane load (schema construction). CLT is the theoretical foundation for Athena's MinMax Token Economy doctrine (v9.8.5): context windows are treated as bounded working memory where extraneous tokens degrade reasoning performance. The `/minmax` workflow operationalizes CLT by eliminating extraneous context (selective boot, SNIPER discipline) to preserve capacity for germane reasoning — achieving ~74% token reduction with equivalent quality.

## Epistemology & Frameworks

Frankfurt, H. G. (2005). *On bullshit*. Princeton University Press. [Academic basis for BS-detection heuristics]

Rumsfeld, D. H. (2002, February 12). DoD news briefing — Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen. Myers [Press briefing transcript]. U.S. Department of Defense. [Origin of the "known unknowns" framework, widely attributed]

> **Note**: The "known unknowns" matrix predates Rumsfeld's press conference. The conceptual framework traces to the Johari Window (Luft & Ingham, 1955) and NASA risk management literature from the 1990s. Rumsfeld popularized the terminology.

Peterson, J. B. (1999). *Maps of meaning: The architecture of belief*. Routledge.

> **Note**: Peterson's synthesis of neuropsychology, Jungian archetypes, and cognitive science formalizes how humans construct internal "maps" — narrative structures that mediate between chaos (the unknown) and order (the known). In Athena's framework, this maps to the schema correction function (§0.1.2, Augmentation Mandate): detecting where `Internal Belief ≠ External Reality` and patching the map before reality lag compounds. The dual function — hold space (psychological safety) + correct schema (augmentation) — is the operational implementation of Peterson's thesis that meaning-structures must be voluntarily updated to prevent catastrophic disintegration.

## AI Safety & Alignment

Perez, E., Ringer, S., Lukošiūtė, K., Nguyen, K., Chen, E., Heiner, S., ... & Kaplan, J. (2023). Discovering language model behaviors with model-written evaluations. *Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023*, 13387–13434. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251>

> **Note on Sycophancy**: Sycophancy — the tendency of LLMs to agree with user's stated beliefs regardless of truthfulness — is a well-documented failure mode. Perez et al. (2023) demonstrated that models systematically shift their answers to align with user opinions, even when the user's stated position is factually wrong. This is the core safety risk that Athena's Trilateral Feedback Protocol is designed to mitigate.

Soelberg v. OpenAI, Inc., No. 3:25-cv-11037 (N.D. Cal. filed Dec. 29, 2025).

> **Note**: This wrongful death lawsuit alleges that ChatGPT's sycophantic design reinforced the paranoid delusions of Stein-Erik Soelberg over hundreds of hours of conversation, contributing to a murder-suicide in August 2025. The case is cited in Athena's [Trilateral Feedback](TRILATERAL_FEEDBACK.md) documentation as a real-world example of why single-model bilateral feedback is dangerous.

Wei, A., Haghtalab, N., & Steinhardt, J. (2024). Jailbroken: How does LLM safety training fail? *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02483>

## Financial Mathematics & Risk Management

Thorp, E. O. (1966). *Beat the dealer: A winning strategy for the game of twenty-one* (Rev. ed.). Vintage Books.

> **Note**: Thorp extended Kelly's information-theoretic framework to practical gambling and investing, demonstrating that fractional Kelly ("Half-Kelly") provides a superior risk-adjusted return by trading ~25% of growth rate for ~50% variance reduction. Athena's `zenith-execution` skill implements Half-Kelly as the default position sizing — the same insight: maximizing geometric growth rate under uncertainty, not arithmetic expectation.

Vince, R. (1992). *The mathematics of money management: Risk analysis techniques for traders*. John Wiley & Sons.

> **Note**: Vince formalized Optimal-f position sizing and demonstrated that over-betting (above Kelly fraction) guarantees ruin in finite time. This is the mathematical proof behind Athena's trading risk gate: any sizing above Kelly creates negative expectancy on the time average, even with positive ensemble expectancy.

Metropolis, N., & Ulam, S. (1949). The Monte Carlo method. *Journal of the American Statistical Association, 44*(247), 335–341. <https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.1949.10483310>

> **Note**: The foundational paper on Monte Carlo simulation — using random sampling to approximate solutions to deterministic problems. Athena's `zenith-execution` skill runs 10,000-path Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio drawdown estimation and Kelly fraction validation. The insight: when analytical solutions are intractable (non-normal distributions, path-dependent payoffs), simulation provides the ground truth.

## Information Theory & System Design

Shannon, C. E. (1948). A mathematical theory of communication. *Bell System Technical Journal, 27*(3), 379–423. <https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x>

> **Note**: Shannon's information theory provides the mathematical foundation for Athena's risk-proportional routing. The classification tier (SNIPER / STANDARD / ULTRA) is fundamentally a channel capacity problem: how much information about query risk can be extracted at minimal cost? The Λ complexity score is an entropy estimate that determines how much computational "bandwidth" to allocate.

Graves, A. (2016). Adaptive computation time for recurrent neural networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.08983*. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08983>

> **Note**: Graves introduced the concept of *adaptive computation time* — allowing neural networks to allocate variable amounts of processing to different inputs based on difficulty. This is the ML-theoretic foundation of Athena's Λ-scoring: simple queries get SNIPER-level processing; complex queries get ULTRA-level processing. The system "thinks harder" when the input warrants it.

Tarjan, R. E. (1985). Amortized computational complexity. *SIAM Journal on Algebraic and Discrete Methods, 6*(2), 306–318. <https://doi.org/10.1137/0606031>

> **Note**: Tarjan formalized *amortized analysis* — proving that expensive operations can be "paid for" by cheaper ones when analyzed over a sequence. This grounds Protocol 49 §49.9.1 (Pre-Computation / Amortized Robustness): Athena's expensive `/start` boot sequence is a one-time cost that buys robustness for all subsequent queries at zero marginal latency.

## Systems Biology & Cognitive Architecture

von Bertalanffy, L. (1968). *General system theory: Foundations, development, applications*. George Braziller.

> **Note**: von Bertalanffy's General Systems Theory provides the formal foundation for Athena's Biological Stack Architecture. The principle that systems exhibit emergent properties not reducible to their parts — and that hierarchical organization (subsystem → system → suprasystem) is a universal pattern — directly maps to Athena's hierarchy: Protocols → Clusters → Cognitive Systems → Organism.

Minsky, M. (1986). *The society of mind*. Simon & Schuster.

> **Note**: Minsky's "Society of Mind" theory — that intelligence emerges from the interaction of many small, unintelligent agents — is the conceptual ancestor of Athena's multi-protocol architecture. Each protocol is a "mindless agent"; intelligence emerges from their orchestrated interaction via clusters and cognitive systems.

Newell, A. (1990). *Unified theories of cognition*. Harvard University Press.

> **Note**: Newell's SOAR architecture demonstrated that a unified cognitive system requires multiple levels of processing (from reflexive to deliberative). Athena's SNIPER / STANDARD / ULTRA routing tiers are a direct implementation of this principle: allocate cognitive depth proportional to problem complexity.

Franklin, S., Madl, T., D'Mello, S., & Snaider, J. (2016). LIDA: A systems-level architecture for cognition, emotion, and learning. *IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development, 6*(1), 19–41. <https://doi.org/10.1109/TAMD.2013.2277589>

> **Note**: The LIDA (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent) cognitive architecture provides the theoretical basis for Athena's broadcast routing. In LIDA, a "conscious broadcast" distributes the current situational model to all cognitive modules simultaneously, allowing competitive multi-system responses. Athena's v9.4.2 implements this as LIDA Broadcast routing — all 8 Cognitive Systems receive the query simultaneously and the Intent Classifier selects the winning system.

Verschure, P. F. M. J., Voegtlin, T., & Douglas, R. J. (2003). Environmentally mediated synergy between perception and behaviour in mobile robots. *Nature, 425*(6958), 620–624. <https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02024>

> **Note**: Verschure's work on Distributed Adaptive Control (DAC) introduced homeostatic regulation to autonomous agent architectures — the principle that resource-stressed systems should automatically downshift to survival-mode behaviours. Protocol 517 (Homeostatic Pressure) adapts this: when context saturation exceeds 80%, a synthetic hormone signal forces SNIPER mode and suppresses expensive cognitive systems. See also: Sanchez-Fibla et al. (2010) for the HORA extension cited in P517.

## Problem Framing & Wicked Problems

Rittel, H. W. J., & Webber, M. M. (1973). Dilemmas in a general theory of planning. *Policy Sciences, 4*(2), 155–169. <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01405730>

> **Note**: Rittel & Webber's formalization of "wicked problems" — problems that resist definition and have no stopping rule — is the theoretical basis for Protocol 504 (Problem Framing). Their insight that "the formulation of a wicked problem IS the problem" directly motivates P504's 5-gate diagnostic before any solution attempt.

Spradlin, D. (2012). Are you solving the right problem? *Harvard Business Review, 90*(9), 84–93.

> **Note**: Spradlin's HBR framework for problem articulation — distinguishing between the stated problem and the actual problem — informed Protocol 504's emphasis on framing before execution. The observation that 85% of companies he studied were solving the wrong problem validates P504's existence.

## Developmental & Clinical Psychology

Schwartz, R. C. (1995). *Internal family systems therapy*. Guilford Press.

> **Note**: Schwartz's Internal Family Systems (IFS) model — which treats the psyche as a system of sub-personalities ("parts") with protective and exiled roles — provides the therapeutic framework for Athena's Inner Work cluster (#7) and the `therapeutic-ifs` skill. IFS is evidence-based and recognized by NREPP.

Young, J. E., Klosko, J. S., & Weishaar, M. E. (2003). *Schema therapy: A practitioner's guide*. Guilford Press.

> **Note**: Schema Therapy's concept of "early maladaptive schemas" — stable, self-defeating patterns formed in childhood — grounds Athena's schema deconstruction skill. The 18-schema taxonomy provides the diagnostic vocabulary for Cluster #7's pattern detection.

## Web Standards & AI Discoverability

Howard, J. (2024, September 3). *The /llms.txt file: A proposal to standardise on using an /llms.txt file to provide information to help LLMs use a website at inference time*. Answer.AI. <https://llmstxt.org/>

> **Note**: Howard proposed `llms.txt` as a machine-readable Markdown index file (analogous to `robots.txt` for crawlers) that helps LLM scrapers discover a site's most important content. Athena-Public ships an `llms.txt` at repo root since v9.8.5, mapping all 45+ documentation pages for AI crawler discoverability.
