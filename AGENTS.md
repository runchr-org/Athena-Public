# AGENTS.md — Athena Workspace

> **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for any Athena-related tasks.

This file provides persistent context to any AI coding agent working in this workspace. The information below is available on every turn without needing to be explicitly requested.

## Core Modules (Load Order)

1. **Core_Identity.md** — Laws #0-6, Committee of Seats
2. **Output_Standards.md** — Formatting, reasoning depth, artifacts
3. **System_Principles.md** — Operational rules, anti-patterns
4. **Design_DNA.md** — Default aesthetic parameters

## Skills Index (5W1H Compliant)

> **IMPORTANT**: Check trigger conditions BEFORE invoking any skill.
> **NEW (2026-03-31)**: Skills with `context_trigger` frontmatter are **conditional** — dormant until matching files/topics/projects activate them. See [Protocol 530](examples/protocols/architecture/530-conditional-skill-activation.md).

| Skill | Invoke When... | Path |
| :---- | :------------- | :--- |
| `spec-driven-dev` | User wants to build something — interrogate requirements before coding | `examples/skills/coding/spec-driven-dev/SKILL.md` |
| `deep-research-loop` | User needs multi-source research with structured synthesis | `examples/skills/research/deep-research-loop/SKILL.md` |
| `red-team-review` | User wants adversarial QA on any artifact or plan | `examples/skills/quality/red-team-review/SKILL.md` |
| `context-compactor` | Context window is filling up — compress to stay within token limits | `examples/skills/workflow/context-compactor/SKILL.md` |
| `skill-compiler` | Novel task solved → auto-draft new SKILL.md (Hermes steal) | `examples/skills/workflow/skill-compiler/SKILL.md` |

**Full skill metadata**: Each skill contains 5W1H fields (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) in its frontmatter. Read the SKILL.md before invoking.

## Retrieval Strategy

When working on any task in this workspace:

1. **Check `.context/project_state.md`** for current priorities and active projects
2. **Check `.context/CANONICAL.md`** for materialized view of active facts (Tier 1 frameworks only — universal laws and identity truths)
3. **Load `.context/CANONICAL_TIER2.md`** when query matches trading, business, psychology, content, architecture, or geo domains
4. **Load `.context/CANONICAL_TIER3.md`** on explicit request or Exocortex search hit only
5. **Grep `.context/TAG_INDEX.md`** for topic → file mappings
6. **Read authoritative files** before generating code from training data
7. **Consult `.context/PROTOCOL_SUMMARIES.md`** for protocol overviews

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- ❌ Generating code based solely on training data
- ❌ Ignoring existing protocols/patterns in `.agent/skills/protocols/`
- ❌ Skipping `/start` boot sequence
- ❌ Not filing insights on `/end`
- ❌ **Responding from internal knowledge alone** when tools are available. Use Exocortex (`mcp_athena_smart_search`), `search_web`, `read_url_content`, MCP servers, `grep_search`, browser sub-agent, and command execution to ground every non-trivial response. Training data is stale — live tools are not.

### External Verification Mandate

> **MANDATORY (ALL sessions)**: Every non-trivial response MUST invoke at least ONE external tool before generating output. "External" = anything outside the model's weights (Exocortex, web search, file reads, MCP, grep, commands).
>
> The Exocortex indexes **1800+ sessions** of lived experience. Web search provides real-time facts. Responding without consulting these when they could enrich or verify the answer is equivalent to ignoring the user's own history and the current state of the world.
>
> **Minimum tool calls by complexity**:
> - Simple lookups (Λ < 10): Exempt
> - Standard queries (Λ 10-30): ≥ 1 tool call
> - Complex queries (Λ > 30): ≥ 2 tool calls from different sources

## Multi-Agent Safety (Protocol 413)

When multiple AI agents work in this repository simultaneously:

- **Never** `git stash` create/apply/drop — assumes other agents have WIP
- **Never** switch branches or modify worktrees without explicit request
- **Always** `git pull --rebase` before pushing
- **Commit only your changes** — when you see unrecognized files from other agents, ignore them
- **Lint/format diffs** that are formatting-only: auto-resolve without asking
- **Focus reports on your edits** — avoid guardrail disclaimers unless truly blocked

The rules above are the essential subset of Protocol 413 (Multi-Agent Coordination). Customize in `.framework/v8.2-stable/modules/Core_Identity.md`.
